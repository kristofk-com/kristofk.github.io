title: A new beginning

Hello there,

Welcome to the new face of kristofk.com. This is the new version of kristofk.com. The previous version was created with WordPress. However for the content that is hosted on this website I decided that a static website would be better suited so here we are.

The previous version of this website with all my old blog posts and content can still be found at [wp.kristofk.com](https://wp.kristofk.com) which of course stands for wordpress.kristofk.com.

The reason I'm keeping the old website is because I spent a lot of time developing content for it and also, it host my [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/kristofk) account.

Going into the future only this website will receive new content and updates.
